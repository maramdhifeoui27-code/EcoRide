Origin Story:

The Genesis

EcoRide-TN was conceived by three Tunisian university students — a software engineer, a business student, and a data analyst — who noticed rising urban congestion in Tunis and a lack of eco-friendly mobility options. Inspired by AI technology, they envisioned scooters that know where they are needed most.

The Beginning
In the heart of Tunis, the team realized there were no local scooter-sharing services. International models existed but were unsuitable for Tunisian streets, local regulations, and user habits. The solution: build a data-driven, AI-powered scooter-sharing service, tailored for the city.

The Journey

Early Obstacles
Introducing a completely new product meant the market didn’t exist yet. Regulators had limited experience with scooter-sharing. Users were skeptical, and operational logistics (charging, parking, maintenance) were untested.

The Pilot
The team deployed a small fleet of scooters in Lac 2, Centre Ville, Ennasr, Manar University, and Sidi Bou Saïd, using AI to predict daily demand. GPS-enabled scooters sent real-time data to refine placement algorithms, while user feedback was collected via a simple mobile app.

Scaling Smartly
With AI-powered analytics, scooters were repositioned daily. Partnerships with universities and local businesses helped increase adoption. Social campaigns highlighted eco-friendliness, convenience, and smart urban mobility.
