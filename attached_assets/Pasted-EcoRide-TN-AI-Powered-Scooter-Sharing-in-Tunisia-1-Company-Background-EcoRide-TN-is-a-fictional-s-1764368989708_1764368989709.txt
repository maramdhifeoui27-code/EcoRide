EcoRide-TN: AI-Powered Scooter Sharing in Tunisia
1. Company Background

EcoRide-TN is a fictional startup created by a group of students in Tunisia. The company’s mission is to provide efficient, eco-friendly mobility for students, youth, and tourists in Tunis. Inspired by the success of scooter-sharing services in Europe and the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI), EcoRide-TN envisions smart scooter placement, predicting where scooters will be most needed each day based on weather, local events, foot traffic, and tourist activity.

As a student project, EcoRide-TN allows learners to explore how AI can optimize urban transportation, even in a market where scooter-sharing does not yet exist.

2. Strategic Challenge / Management Question

The central strategic question facing EcoRide-TN is:

“How can we use AI to place scooters smartly in a market where this product does not exist yet?”

Key challenges include:

Lack of awareness among potential users about scooter-sharing.

Urban regulations and infrastructure constraints in Tunis.

Operational challenges such as maintenance, recharging, and theft prevention.

Demand uncertainty, since no historical data exists in Tunisia for scooter-sharing.

The case requires students to think strategically about market entry, technology adoption, and operational planning in a novel environment.

3. Environmental Analysis
PESTEL Analysis

Political: Tunisia is generally supportive of green mobility, but regulations for scooter use and urban road safety must be considered.

Economic: Affordable mobility solutions are in demand among students and young professionals.

Social: Increasing awareness of eco-friendly transportation; acceptance depends on safety and convenience.

Technological: AI and data analytics are feasible tools to optimize scooter placement and monitor operations.

Environmental: Promotes sustainable urban transport, reduces congestion and pollution.

Legal: Compliance with traffic laws, licensing, and safety regulations is mandatory.

SWOT Analysis

Strengths: Innovative use of AI, eco-friendly mobility, student-driven project with learning value.

Weaknesses: Lack of historical demand data, limited resources for pilot deployment.

Opportunities: Growing urban population, potential partnerships with universities and tourist areas.

Threats: Resistance to adoption, potential vandalism or theft, regulatory changes.

4. Strategy Formulation

EcoRide-TN’s strategy focuses on AI-driven optimization to maximize scooter utilization:

Goals:

Introduce the first AI-powered scooter-sharing service in Tunisia.

Optimize placement daily to meet demand efficiently.

Promote sustainable, eco-friendly urban mobility.

AI Implementation Scenarios:

Weekdays: High demand near universities and business districts.

Weekends: Tourist zones and recreational areas.

Rainy days: Lower demand; focus on sheltered or indoor locations.

The AI uses multiple inputs (weather, events, foot traffic) to predict daily demand and suggest optimal scooter distribution.

5. Implementation

Pilot Deployment Plan in Tunis:

Data Collection: Gather location, foot traffic, and event data.

AI Model Setup: Train the model on simulated data for student analysis.

Daily Placement Simulation: Use AI outputs to place scooters in predicted high-demand zones (Lac 2, Centre Ville, Ennasr, Manar University, Sidi Bou Saïd).

Maintenance and Recharging: Plan routine maintenance based on predicted usage.

Monitoring & Feedback: Track AI accuracy using simulated utilization metrics.

Example: A map heatmap showing zones of predicted high demand can illustrate the concept.

6. Evaluation & Performance Metrics

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Scooter utilization rate (rides per scooter per day).

AI prediction accuracy (correlation between predicted and actual demand).

Customer satisfaction (simulated survey or feedback).

Operational efficiency (maintenance and repositioning costs).

Adjustment Strategies:

Modify AI placement algorithm based on pilot results.

Focus on zones with lower utilization to improve adoption.

7. Teaching Notes

Discussion Questions:

What challenges exist when introducing an innovative mobility service in a new market?

How can AI improve operational efficiency for urban transportation?

What environmental, social, and regulatory factors must be considered in Tunisia?

How would you evaluate the success of the AI placement strategy?

Suggested Answers / Guidance:

Encourage students to consider market adoption barriers, urban infrastructure, and cultural factors.

Discuss how AI can optimize resources, predict demand, and support decision-making.

Analyze KPIs critically, and explore how student simulations can illustrate AI effectiveness.

8. Conclusion

EcoRide-TN is a student-designed case study demonstrating how AI can enable smarter, greener urban transportation. By integrating AI into operational decision-making, students can explore the challenges and opportunities of launching innovative services in new markets.
